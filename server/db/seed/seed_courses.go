How the hardware and firmware architecture of a system supports (or prevents) trust will be gained. How secure modules such as the Trusted Platform Module is utilised in boot-time, run-time and supply-chain security. The processes of attestation will be investigated. A practical component here will be setting up a remote attestation system and investigating the behaviour of the students’ own laptops/computer or other devices as necessary will be made. Practical knowledge of TPM, LVFS, IMA, grub, tboot, TXT and other mechanisms will be obtained through exercises. Coverage of confidential computing topics such as SGX, TDX and other enclaving schemes will be made. This will extend to how trust may be utilised in cloud operations, scheduling, and orchestration. Advanced topics such as attestation’s place in digital forensics and legal aspects such as NIS2 requirements will finalise the course.",

Report on the training. After the training concludes, a free-form report will be written by the student. Preferable length of the report is 5 pages, and it should be approved by the supervisor at the training organisation before handing it in for evaluation (pass/fail). The contents of the report should mainly reflect on the things learned during the training. The purpose of the written report is also to familiarize the student with the training organisation as a whole, and reflect on and analyse their own working capabilities. The report could include for example: - info on the duration of the training (start & end dates) and in the case of a part-time training contract, a summary of weekly working time or total working hours - brief info on the mission and history of the organisation - description of duties - reflecting on knowledge and skills for the job (helpful skills, strengths, needs for improvement) - reflecting on learning during the training (skills prior to the training, skills learned during the training) - possible career development opportunities in the organization (what sort of career development opportunities, do they require enhancing some specific skills or broadening some specific knowledge).

            LearningOutcomes: "Semantic Technology leverages artificial intelligence to simulate how people understand language and process information. It uses formal semantics to give meaning to the disparate and raw data that surrounds us. Semantic Technology is designed to standardize and support interoperability and integration of information content and capabilities (services) of Web-based systems and components at local and global scale. As a software technology semantic technology encodes meanings separately from data and from application code to enable machines to understand, share and reason with them at execution time. This course provides practical introduction on storing, querying, merging and reasoning with the metadata and ontologies for the semantic applications; as well as covers aspects of semantic programming and Linked Data. At the same time, the course addresses the challenge related to the Web of Things where all the things are interconnected and interoperate with each other regardless of whether a thing is a real world object, a digital entity or human. Following the vision of Everything-as-a-Service, in addition to a traditional GUI (where a user of applications and services is assumed to be a human), the course concerns interfaces needed if a user of the application happens to be some other application, service, device or any other thing. Such Everything-to-Everything interfaces in addition to the traditional service APIs have to enable understanding among interacting entities, which requires either sharing common ontology or the support for the ontology alignment process followed by semantically enhanced interaction. Thus, course will review available techniques and tools for practical design of Semantic Web Services as well.",

Voit myös ehdottaa omaa aihettasi. Erikoistyön on oltava vaativampi ja laajempi kuin esim. TIEA212 Graafisten käyttöliittymien ohjelmointi tai TIEA218 Web-sovellukset -kursseilla tehdyt tehtävät ja harjoitustyöt. Erikoistöitä ohjaavat professorit, lehtorit ja yliassistentit, joista jonkun tulee hyväksyä aihe-ehdotus jo ennen työn aloittamista. Erikoistyöhön liittyvän dokumentoinnin vaatimukset ovat seuraavat: Dokumentoinnissa tulee perustella tarve tehdylle ohjelmalle, kuvata konteksti ohjelmalle, eli ohjelman tekninen ja toiminnallinen ympäristö, kuvata ohjelman vaatimukset ja ominaisuudet, analysoida, mikä ohjelman teossa oli vaikeaa ja mikäs suoraviivaista, sekä selvittää, miten hyvin työ onnistui tai mitä olisi kannattanut tehdä toisin. Dokumentoinnin tulee myös sisältää ohjelman suunnitteludokumentaation, esim. arkkitehtuurin ja siinä tehdyt valinnat perustellusti, sekä koodin kuvauksen vähintään luokkatasolla (jos ei ole käytetty oliokieliä, niin riittävä tarkkuus käytetyssä paradigmassa sovitaan ohjaajan kanssa). Ohjaus ja tarkastusvaiheessa on lähdekoodien oltava ohjaajan nähtävissä, mutta suositeltavaa on lisenssien ja mahdollisuuksien rajoissa lisätä dokumentaatioon ohjeistus, miten niitä pääsee kuka tahansa työn lukija tarkastelemaan.
